Project-2 (end-of-line rule) (10%)  
Please see a picture below, which describes this rule. Letâ€™s say
EOL spacing between objects 1 and 2 is at least 1 (um).  
Length of end is 0.6 (um) (i.e., if the width of object-1 is smaller & equal than 0.6, consider.)  
Parallel length from the top of edge 1 is 0.7 (um).  
Parallel halo away from object-1 is 0.4 (um)  
Layout patterns are described below.
