## Project 2 (end-of-line rule) intro
Please see a picture below, which describes this rule. Letâ€™s say
EOL spacing between objects 1 and 2 is at least 1 (um).  
Length of end is 0.6 (um) (i.e., if the width of object-1 is smaller & equal than 0.6, consider.)  
Parallel length from the top of edge 1 is 0.7 (um).  
Parallel halo away from object-1 is 0.4 (um)  
Layout patterns are described below.  


## How to use
Execute the following commands in terminal:
```bash
cd "/path/to/dir/"
```
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 proj2.cpp -o proj2.out 
```
```bash
"/path/to/dir/"proj2.out
```  
SVG output result: ```output.svg```  
```RED``` line: DRC violation exists.  
```GREEN``` line: No DRC violation.

## Implementation  
### spec.txt 
spec.txt contains the spec of polygons, rectangles and texts. 
The first number indicates the ```No.metal```  
```
number_of_layers 1
layer 1   M1
end_of_layer
number_of_rectangles  6
1  0  4.0,   7.8  0.6  # should be 4.0 0, 7.8 0.6?  
1  0 1.0,   6.1  1.6
1  2.0  2.0,  4.0  2.6
1  7.0  1.0,  14 1.6
1  10.4 0.8,  11 1.8
1   8.6  2.2,  14  2.8
end_of_rectangle
```  

### read_spec.hpp  
This program reads the spec from spec.txt and saves the shapes as OBJECTS with coordinate, width and length.  

### proj2.cpp  
#### 1. Check overlappings of line by ```intersection```. If one line overlap another line, make that line as a member line of the overlapped line. (group3_proj2/test_demo/line_overlap.svg)

#### 2. EOL checking by ```intersection```. Define the EOL area of each line. If the EOL area overlap any line, turn the line's color into red and show the warning text. Skip this check if the length of line > 0.6 um or the checking line is one of member lines needed to be checked. (group3_proj2/test_demo/output.svg)
